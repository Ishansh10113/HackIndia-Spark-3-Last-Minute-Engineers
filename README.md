This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast stock prices and trends in the stock market. The goal is to create a robust and reliable system that can provide investors and traders with valuable insights to make informed investment decisions.

Objectives:

Collect and preprocess historical stock market data from various sources
Develop and train a machine learning model to predict stock prices and trends
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics and techniques
Implement a user-friendly interface to display predictions and insights
Continuously update and refine the model to adapt to changing market conditions
Deliverables:

A functional machine learning model that can predict stock prices and trends with a high degree of accuracy
A user-friendly interface to display predictions and insights
A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and limitations of the project
A dataset of preprocessed historical stock market data
Technical Requirements:

Programming skills in Python or R
Experience with machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
Familiarity with data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
Knowledge of stock market data sources and APIs (e.g. Yahoo Finance, Quandl, Alpha Vantage)
Understanding of evaluation metrics for machine learning models (e.g. mean absolute error, mean squared error, R-squared)
Benefits:

Provides accurate and reliable predictions of stock prices and trends
Enables investors and traders to make informed investment decisions
Offers a competitive edge in the stock market by leveraging machine learning and data analysis
Can be integrated with existing trading platforms and systems
Methodology:

Data collection: Collect historical stock market data from various sources
Data preprocessing: Clean, transform, and preprocess the data for modeling
Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the data to improve model performance
Model development: Develop and train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data
Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics and techniques
Model refinement: Continuously update and refine the model to adapt to changing market conditions.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
